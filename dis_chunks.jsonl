{"text": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Dear Sir, I have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don’t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below. In GA 1 ques 13 and GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager. But, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages. In GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that? Also after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package. In GA 2 ques 8, uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed. In GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance? Many ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that? And many more Most tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel. Vercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks. Many of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation. I can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime. Also, some ques requires external toolings like In GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365. In GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there? GA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can’t be installed locally. How to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools. Also, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like In GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or Data URI. Some ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used “Save as” to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment? Another concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then. Please advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.", "metadata": {"topic_id": 169029, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/28", "author": "PREMDEEP MAITI", "created_at": "2025-03-05T18:08:24.132Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}

{"text": "Hello Sir, I have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same. Currently answers that we have entered for GA’s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we’ve entered as well for verification purposes. The first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code. Can you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB.

{"text": "I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs. Alternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I’m curious about your preference. Additionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code. Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that’s where you’ll spend most of your time, so make sure you’re comfortable with it. Visual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you’ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial. To get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs: Getting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min) Code Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min) Productivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min) Personalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min) Extensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min) Debugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min) Version Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min) Customize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min) AI Editors: Copilot, Cursor Note: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer’s toolkit. Please make sure to use them. To install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s , then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below. What is the output of code -s ? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user’s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user. As for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent.

{"text": "@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday’s Session) Respected TDS Team, As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following @Saransh ’s suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation. Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue GA3 Q8 Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag. GA3 Q9 Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN. Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation? GA4 Q2 & Q10 Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved. Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution Output Formatting (Multiple Questions) Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added. Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok. Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably? Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage. File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems. Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.", "metadata": {"topic_id": 169029, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/107", "author": "Aarush saxena ", "created_at": "2025-03-26T04:35:37.877Z", "topic_title": "", "images": [{"alt": ":red_exclamation_mark:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/red_exclamation_mark.png?v=14"}]}}

{"text": "Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file. Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters. The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists. The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters.

{"text": "@carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini GA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages As part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system. To automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page’s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10–20 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process—from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live—takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine. However, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly—before the GitHub Pages site is actually live—resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure’s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform’s allowed response duration. GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. Currently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.

{"text": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Final Thoughts on Project 2 Project 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I’d like to share a few reflections—not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations. Organization & Structure: The project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I’m not blaming anyone—just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback. Deployment & Portal Limitations: There are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning. Time Constraints: Balancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments. Sessions & Support: The sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward. Deployment Variability: Each GA’s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably. Effort Acknowledgment: I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors—it’s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it’s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail—even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment. Feasibility in the Given Timeline: Even for someone with a technical background, it’s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn’t always feasible before the deadline. I genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully—I’d love to learn from their experience and solutions. Again, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know—I’m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.

{"text": "Hello Sir, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py , which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions. However, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as “question.pdf.” How can I effectively manage this problem? Furthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word “code” and executes first.py for GA1.

Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use gpt-4o-mini as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note : This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one.

{"text": "I reuesting to all my teachers @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj , @Saransh_Saini please reply me. What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read. It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.

{"text": "hi, I dont share your views. i feel it was one of the best course in whole of Diploma. I have learned a lot in these projects and even in ROE preparation. all the things we are learning here are open in market and the course contents are great direction towards learning and practicing them. I agree it is stessful, my whole team were in a 9-hour g-meet call on Saturday night. but we have found solutions, shared ideas, try-outs, made fun of each other. but at the end of the day we all agree that we have learnt lots of new things. Regarding Project1 delay: if we think, atleast 1GB of docker image per students for 700+ students. even if parallalize the execution 5 students at a time you still need a very powerfull system to download and amount of data downloading etc… At the end of the day we got a very good result and report with logs to verify for GA’s: it is upto you to copy solutions or learn something out of each GA sections All in all I am happy with the course.", "metadata": {"topic_id": 169029, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/311", "author": "Vinil", "created_at": "2025-04-02T09:32:33.036Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}

{"text": "Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: What is this going on? Is it joking? I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \" That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.

{"text": "Hi, I have a few things to say My background : I have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term. My Initial Disappointments with this Course In one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction): The video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended. Here, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn’t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph ROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful. There are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily. Why did I fail? Last Term I dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn’t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon. This term. I made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn’t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn’t submit both the projects. In both the terms I didn’t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn’t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair. Me Understanding about the Course Now This one line changed my view about ROE. On another topic What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. I am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don’t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough. I scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS. Now I realize that I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time. In MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn . Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE. This course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way. This is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code. I have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks I have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc. I am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt. From the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn’t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn’t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects. Since this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too. Thanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj and @Saransh_Saini Just two suggestions I feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites. While introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.", "metadata": {"topic_id": 169029, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/315", "author": "B R GIRI SUBRAHMANYA", "created_at": "2025-04-02T12:44:19.919Z", "topic_title": "", "images": [{"alt": "", "src": "https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/s.anand/48/15264_2.png"}]}}

{"text": ": From Problem to Platform: Building “Vicky” – A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras Project Demo Website : https://app.algsoch.tech During our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras , we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API . The Mission: Create a tool that behaves like a chatbot , accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API , processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code , and returns accurate results—like a real data science assistant. The Journey: From Fails to Final At first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents —they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. Then I thought—what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure ? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files , or queried in non-standard formats like “code -s” or “code -v”. The next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1–GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping After multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture: Centralized engine in vicky_server.py Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None) Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools Presenting Vicky – The Mini Chatbot for TDS Vicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras . It’s packed with real functionality—not just templates. Key Features: Graded Assignment Solver Handles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like: code -s / code -v → VS terminal commands Create FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching GitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup Data cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression File Upload with Query Matching Users can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file. HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder View any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy Upload Base64 string → Get original image back Webhooks Integration Live notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed Monitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates LLM Download + Auto Tunneling Downloads LLaMA models Dynamically finds available ports Creates and exposes tunneled endpoints Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech Ask any TDS question Upload and query with files Image decoder Graded assignment slider navigation HTML viewer API health status Built With: FastAPI for blazing fast APIs Regex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection GitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking Full webhook and status monitoring system Modular backend ( vicky_server.py ) and web frontend ( vicky_app.py ) I want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I’ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won’t replace our jobs—especially for those who understand programming—they will create new job opportunities instead. Now I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project", "metadata": {"topic_id": 169029, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-2-tds-solver-discussion-thread/169029/341", "author": "Vicky Kumar", "created_at": "2025-04-04T06:37:32.871Z", "topic_title": "", "images": [{"alt": ":graduation_cap:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/graduation_cap.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":rocket:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/rocket.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":brain:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/brain.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":counterclockwise_arrows_button:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/counterclockwise_arrows_button.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":cross_mark:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":cross_mark:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/cross_mark.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":wrench:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/wrench.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":white_check_mark:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":white_check_mark:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":white_check_mark:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":white_check_mark:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":white_check_mark:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/white_check_mark.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":globe_with_meridians:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/globe_with_meridians.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":fire:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/fire.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":brain:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/brain.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":open_file_folder:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/open_file_folder.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":globe_showing_europe_africa:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/globe_showing_europe_africa.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":robot:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/robot.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":spouting_whale:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/spouting_whale.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":chart_increasing:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/chart_increasing.png?v=14"}, {"alt": ":man_technologist:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/man_technologist.png?v=14"}]}}

Upon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on Railway and submitted that link as well. If possible, I kindly request either of the following: Re-evaluation using the Railway link I provided, or Re-evaluation using the Render link , with allowance for the 50–60 second activation time. Your consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.

{"text": "@Jivraj @carlton I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message. I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday. These are the detailed point wise concerns : I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course. By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply. I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them. I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link. I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair. Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge. I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.

{"text": "@Jivraj @carlton Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80 ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy} ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy} This was required as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup.. So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container started up without issues.. Checkin url: Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well.. didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image..

{"text": "@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted. However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. image 1272×395 25.7 KB But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models . Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP , utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents , and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent . Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29 , after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0 —since it was already evaluated and graded. Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj", "metadata": {"topic_id": 171141, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/tds-official-project1-discrepencies/171141/206", "author": "Shreyan Chaubey", "created_at": "2025-04-01T19:02:11.386Z", "topic_title": "", "images": [{"alt": "image", "src": "https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/a/9acc2fc47ea84b9e26c1ed21442ba873d0dca20e.png"}]}}

{"text": "We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

{"text": "@carlton Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score. I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again. Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor. Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him. What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating . Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec. In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

{"text": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton . It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether. Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible within the scope of the problem statement . What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. (…caution: long post ahead ) I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use . While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads . No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM. Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to. Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers : merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record. At the core of it, it’s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio. Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to, Reason about the task, understand intent, Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else) Execute those workflows ( walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed. Observe the final result, and repeat if needed. Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper . That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction. To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools : A REPL executor (for quick calcs) A Python script runner A Shell executor With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more. As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was emergent behavior , not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff! I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really! As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities. PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design . At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. TL;DR My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.

{"text": "Respected Sir, Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment. Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash git clone <my_repo_url> cd <my_repo_directory> I built the Docker image using: bash docker build -t. I ran the Docker container with: bash docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed. Finally, I ran the evaluation script using: bash uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: \"Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.

{"text": "Hi @23f1001524 @afsalshah @23f1000879 @23f1002056 I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless. We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure. A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working. Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures. I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.

{"text": "@carlton @jivraj @s.anand , I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night. I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation. I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate. I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.

As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle. I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py . But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent . Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected. I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score.

{"text": "@carlton @Jivraj Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10. image 1298×857 29.4 KB I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow. Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements. Edit 2: Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking. image 1027×510 11 KB Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

{"text": "I hope this message finds you well @jkmadathil sir. Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course. However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. Addressing the queries you raised in your post: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that: Dear Learner, DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission. Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations. https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9 AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email, if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80. You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews. You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus? Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7. … Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews. Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria. Thank you for your time and consideration @jkmadathil sir.

{"text": "Yes @jkmadathil sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email. Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the TDS course focuses more on teamwork and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2. They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you. I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity. Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading. To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly. Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation. I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.

{"text": "It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having: 23f2004636: To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this: Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement. The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other. 192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least). When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort before there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence. Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort. The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie. I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below: # Assignments Done # students 0 42 1 33 2 22 3 19 4 23 5 28 Assignment_Score # students 0-10 75 11-20 19 21-30 15 31-40 9 41-50 13 51-60 7 61-70 11 71-80 12 81-90 10 91-100 17", "metadata": {"topic_id": 172246, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/34", "author": "Jayakrishnan", "created_at": "2025-04-11T08:50:15.525Z", "topic_title": "", "images": [{"alt": "", "src": "https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2004636/48/86136_2.png"}]}}

{"text": "@jkmadathil Sir , Thank you for the detailed explanation. I just have one sincere doubt: As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the total course marks , instead of awarding 15/100 of the total to those who did GA7 exceptionally well? Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too? It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs. I’m only concerned about my own marks , and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.

{"text": "Thanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair. However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so not for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred. Now that bonus marks are announced after the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement. I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.", "metadata": {"topic_id": 172246, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25/172246/40", "author": "Sagandeep Kaur", "created_at": "2025-04-11T13:14:20.773Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}
{"text": "Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course. If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4. The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score. Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they attended GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair. Please think from our side.

{"text": "I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades. As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading. For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus.

{"text": "Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised. jkmadathil: When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence? With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated: “I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.” As mentioned above, my intention was never to express jealousy . It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully. jkmadathil: You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience , knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter. Further, you mentioned: jkmadathil: The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. I completely respect the effort put in by those students. However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication. If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort specific to GA7 , then it might be more fair to reflect that in the GA7 score only, not in the overall course total , which affects students who were consistently involved across the term. I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning.

{"text": "Thank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue. It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility. Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations. Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.

{"text": "@jkmadathil @carlton @s.anand @Jivraj Sir, as said in this another students’ post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks. Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7). We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship. How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment. Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.

{"text": "Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus 600×371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team.

The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance 10418 meters 12287 meters 10965 meters 11149 meters Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question) Also, my question 4 was : As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data. 134483 94774 150666 199711 Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved) Kindly look into it Thanks and Regards", "metadata": {"topic_id": 169283, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/graded-assignment-6/169283/40", "author": "Khushi Shah", "created_at": "2025-03-19T17:09:05.009Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}

{"text": "Hi Andrew, You have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py . It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task ( possibly your first task ) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

{"text": "Hi everyone, I’m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to: bash Copy https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings I receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a KeyError: 'data' because the expected JSON response doesn’t include the \"data\" key. What I’ve Tried Token Verification: I’m using the AIPROXY_TOKEN obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email. The token is passed in the header as follows: python Copy \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\" I added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters). API Request Details: The request includes the correct Content-Type: application/json header. The payload is set as: json Copy {\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]} Despite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized. Debug Output: Here’s a snippet of the debug output: bash Copy HTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\" 🔴 A9 failed: 'data' This confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic. What I Suspect The token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured. There could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I’m not aware of. Alternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation. Request for Help Has anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your assistance!", "metadata": {"topic_id": 164277, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277/541", "author": "Manav Singh", "created_at": "2025-02-16T13:22:14.284Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}

{"text": "lakshaygarg654: GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms . The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing. Each and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.

Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to your response.

I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM. Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last. Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form.

WITH filtered_posts AS ( SELECT post_id FROM social_media WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z' AND EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM social_media AS sm WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4 ) ) SELECT post_id FROM filtered_posts ORDER BY post_id ASC; Kindly check if any issue with Q8.

{"text": "@lakshaygarg654 Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug. Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered post_id So thats where you begin: SELECT post_id FROM ( ... ) ORDER BY post_id Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query. ... ... FROM ( SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars FROM social_media WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given) AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given) ) ... ... Then the final layer of the nest ... ... ( ) as max_stars ... ... You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability) But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.

{"text": "Thank you for your response @carlton . You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including: json_extract : “Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_each : “Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” json_extract_path_text : “Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.” Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog. I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue.

{"text": "QUESTION 9 I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"", "metadata": {"topic_id": 166576, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-data-preparation-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/166576/94", "author": "Swapnila Chakrabarty", "created_at": "2025-02-22T04:48:06.113Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}

{"text": "@23f2003413 We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects.

{"text": "Respected @s.anand , @Jivraj , @carlton Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time. As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk. I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief. Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

{"text": "Dear @jkmadathil @Anand @Bharathi First and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites , leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds —to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback , which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE , which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.", "metadata": {"topic_id": 168476, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/1", "author": "A LAKSHMI", "created_at": "2025-02-25T17:21:11.919Z", "topic_title": "", "images": [{"alt": ":small_blue_diamond:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12"}, {"alt": ":small_blue_diamond:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12"}, {"alt": ":small_blue_diamond:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12"}, {"alt": ":small_blue_diamond:", "src": "https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/small_blue_diamond.png?v=12"}]}}

{"text": "Hi @s.anand @jkmadathil @Bharathi @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini Could you please look into the above issue? Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam? . Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 ( deadline: 16th Feb 2025 ), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals , making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2 , well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support , considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels , ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made.

{"text": "Thank you @A_LAKSHMI for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed . And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.", "metadata": {"topic_id": 168476, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-tds-course-difficulty-and-grading-fairness/168476/9", "author": "Jayakrishnan", "created_at": "2025-02-25T18:34:40.325Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}

We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs.

{"text": "Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works.

Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets.

In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes.

The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"", "metadata": {"topic_id": 168057, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/question-9-of-tds-week-5-ga/168057/1", "author": "Swapnila Chakrabarty", "created_at": "2025-02-22T04:50:25.982Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}

The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required.

{"text": "@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here - Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

{"text": "Sir, I would like to inquire if it would be possible to reconsider the weightage of the projects. As many students are finding it challenging to achieve high score in Project 1 and have been requesting an extension for the deadline. Instead of extending the deadline, I propose adjusting the weightage, allocating 15% to Project 1 and 25% to Project 2. This adjustment seems fair, as Project 2 requires students to build upon the concepts used in Project 1. By making this change, it would provide additional time for improvement and potentially help those who struggled with the first project to to get good scores, without disadvantaging those who performed well initially.

{"text": "Hi Vikram, This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity.

{"text": "@23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine. GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z → 2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

{"text": "@23F300327 Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_GET(self): self.send_response(200) self.send_header('Content-type','application/json') self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\") self.end_headers() self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8')) return Notice there is no if __name__ == \"__main__\": code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == \"__main__\": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

{"text": "@23f1002382 Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

{"text": "Hi Srividya, Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input.

{"text": "Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

{"text": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.", "metadata": {"topic_id": 165922, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922/1", "author": "Shalini Saravanan", "created_at": "2025-01-31T06:26:47.630Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}
{"text": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version , pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3) , you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints : package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards", "metadata": {"topic_id": 165922, "url": "https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python/165922/2", "author": "Carlton D'Silva", "created_at": "2025-01-31T06:50:45.102Z", "topic_title": "", "images": []}}

Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version.

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained.

I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module.

{"text": "Dear all, I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator . This is the basic prototype. This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators. A heartfelt thanks to @s.anand , our course instructor, and TAs @Carlton and @Jivraj , whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible. I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to: Expand functionality and evaluation models. Fix bugs and optimize workflows. Improve documentation for broader accessibility.
